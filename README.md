# Macro-Economic Indicators vs. S&P 500 Factor Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationships between key U.S. macroeconomic indicators (unemployment rate, CPI, retail‐sales growth) and the S&P 500 monthly returns. It covers:
- Data acquisition (FRED for macro series, Stooq for S&P 500 prices)  
- Data cleaning and alignment (resample to month‐end, compute month‐over‐month changes)  
- Exploratory data analysis (time‐series plots, pairwise scatterplots, correlation matrices)  
- Hypothesis testing (OLS regressions and t‐tests for lagged unemployment, lagged retail sales, and CPI regimes)  
- Key findings and next‐step recommendations

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to clean, visualize, and analyze real‐world financial & economic time‐series data in Python, and to produce a concise PDF report highlighting actionable insights for a senior‐level audience.
